  """
  Simulate the generation with payoff matrix T/R/P/S.

  In Nowak and May's model, each individual on the lattice plays the prisoner's
  dilemma with their eight nearest neighbors. At the end of each game round, an
  individual compares her score with that of her neighbors. 
  
  - If one of her neighbors earned a higher score, that player will adopt the
    strategy used by her most successful neighbor (presumably using some kind of
    randomization process to break ties).
  - If no neighbor earned a higher score, that player will continue using the
    same strategy for the next round of play.
  All individuals switch strategies at the same time, and all have the same
  payoff structure.
